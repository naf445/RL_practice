This is a repository for my personal reinforcement learning benefit. 

I am following along with lectures by David Silver, http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html

I am also following somewhat Sutton & Barto 2nd Ed. http://incompleteideas.net/book/RLbook2018.pdf

This github repo has assignments and implementations which I will also follow along with. https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning
